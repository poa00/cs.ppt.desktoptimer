Desktop Timer (very creative name)

A simple timer for Windows made in Windows Forms / C#

## How To Use ##
Open in Visual Studio 2019+ and Build.
In the Release or Debug folder (depending on build option) you will see DesktopTimer.exe.

Double click the .exe, Set the desired time and hit Start.

The Timer will count down, when the timer reaches 0 a horrible green popup will appear.
- it will stay on screen until you hit the "X" on the popup, close the program, hit "Reset" or start the timer again.
